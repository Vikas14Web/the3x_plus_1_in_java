<h1 align="center">3 n + 1 Problem</h1>

The famous 3x + 1 problem performed in java

## Also knows as:
 - Collatz Conjecture
 - Ulam Conjecture
 - Kakutani's Problem
 - Thwaites Conjecture
 - Hasse's Algorithm
 - Syracuse's Problem
 - 3n+1

## Why is this so famous
The 3X + 1 problem is known as the Collatz problem. It focuses on the behavior of the iteration of the function which takes odd integers n to 3n + 1 and even integers n to n/2. The Collatz conjecture declares that no matter starting from any positive integer n, if we repeat the iteration of this function, eventually we will converge to the value 1.

# Now you solve this using this simple program in java !!
